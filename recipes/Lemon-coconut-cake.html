    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Step 1
            <p>For lemon curd, add eg yolks, sugar, lemon zest, lemon juice, salt, and butter to a small non-reactive saucepan over medium-low heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture begins to simmer and has thickened, 8 to 12 minutes. Pour mixture through a gine mesh sieve set over a bowl, using a spatula or wooden spoon to push the mixture through. Cover with a piece of plastic wrap directly touching the top of the curd, and refrigerate until chilled.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 2
            <p>For cakes, preheat the oven to 350&deg; F (175&deg; C). Lightly grease 3 8-inch round cake pans, and line the bottoms with parchment paper.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 3
            <p>Place coconut flakes into a food processor or blender, and pulse a few time until the coconut flakes are finely chopped. Set aside.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 4
            <p>Sift cake flour, baking powder, slat, and nutmeg together in a large bowl.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 5
            <p>in a separate large bowl, beta butter, vegetable oil, and sugar together with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, 3 to 4 minutes. Add in sour cream, lemon juice, and vanilla and mix until thoroughly combined. Add in &#189; of flour mixture and mix until just combined. Add in coconut milk and mix until just combined. Add in remaining flour mixture and mix until just combined.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 6
            <p>in a separate clean bowl, combine egg whites and cream of tartar. With clean beaters, beat egg whites on medium-high speed until stiff peak form, about 5 minutes. Add &#8531; of the egg white mixture into the batter, and fold just until no streaks  of whites remain. Add in remaining egg white mixture and gently fold until no streaks of white remain. Divide batter evenly between the 3 prepared cake pans.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 7
            <p>Bake in the preheated oven until tops of cakes spring back when lightly touched, 20 to 25 minutes. Allow cakes to cool in pans for 20 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 8
            <p>For frosting, cut cold butter into &#189; inch pieces. Place into a bowl. Starting on low speed, beat butter iwth an electric mixer until just loosened. Gradually increase the mixer speed, and beat butter until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add in cold cream cheese, and beat on medium-high speed until completely smooth and combined, about 3 minutes. Add in confectioner's sugar; beat until thoroughly combined. Add in lemon zest, vanilla, and salt and mix until combined. Add in remaining confectioner's sugar, 1 cup at a time, beating well after each addition. Add in 1 tablespoon cold coconut milk and beat mixture on medium-high speed for an additional 2 to 3 minutes. If frosing is a bit too doft to spead onto the cake layers, place it into the fridge for about 10 minures, or unitl it is easier to use.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Step 9
            <p>To assemble the cake, place one ckae layer onto a cake plate or serving platter. Spread a thin layer of cream cheese forsting over the top of the cake. Pipe a ring of fresing around the top edge of the cake. Place about 2 tablespoons of lemon curd in the center of the frosting ring, and smooth into an even layer. Stack another cake layer on top, forst the top and sides of the cake with a thin layer of frosting. Use your hands to press the toasted coconut flakes onto the sides of the cake. If desired, drizzle or swirl the top of cake with some of the extra lemon curd. Place cake into the fridge to chill for about 30 minutes before serving.</p>
